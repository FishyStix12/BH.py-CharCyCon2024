**The Script below is the script we will be analyzing in the first part of the course: **
1. net_terrorizer.py - This script is a tool crafted for ethical hacking endeavors, focusing on network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment. Leveraging the python-nmap library, it orchestrates comprehensive scans on remote hosts, probing for open ports, identifying service versions, and detecting potential security weaknesses. Multithreading capabilities empower the script to concurrently monitor network traffic, triggering Nmap scans upon detecting novel hosts. Users can input either single IP addresses or CIDR notations to specify target ranges for scanning. With integration of the vulners script, the tool extends its functionality to include vulnerability detection, highlighting potential threats and associated CVE identifiers. This versatile script equips ethical hackers with essential insights, aiding in the identification and mitigation of security risks within authorized systems. <br />

**Now it's your turn! Please use the script below to start the development of your very own nmap python tool!** <br />
1. yourTurn.py - It's now your turn to create your own Python Nmap tool using the script provided. This script utilizes the `nmap` library and Scapy to perform a vulnerability scan on a specified host or IP address. It sets up a PortScanner object from `nmap` and performs a comprehensive vulnerability scan with various arguments. The results are then processed and printed, including any vulnerability scripts found for the scanned host. You can expand on this script by adding more functionalities, such as customizing scan options, implementing logging, or integrating it into a larger network security tool. Happy coding! <br />
